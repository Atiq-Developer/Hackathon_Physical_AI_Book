# Review Process for Technical Accuracy, Clarity, and Consistency

This document outlines the review process to ensure the high quality of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook.

## Technical Accuracy Review

-   **Objective**: Verify that all technical claims, descriptions of algorithms, and explanations of hardware/software components are correct and align with official documentation or peer-reviewed research.
-   **Methodology**:
    1.  Each chapter will be reviewed by at least two domain experts (e.g., experienced ROS 2 developers, robotics researchers).
    2.  For every factual assertion, cross-reference with provided citations. If no citation exists, one must be added.
    3.  Verify mathematical formulas and derivations.
    4.  Ensure that descriptions of software (ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim) match their current stable versions.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] All technical statements are correct.
    -   [ ] Appropriate citations are provided for all factual claims.
    -   [ ] Software descriptions match current stable versions.

## Clarity Review

-   **Objective**: Ensure the content is easily understandable for the target audience (intermediate Python, linear algebra, probability, engineering-oriented focus).
-   **Methodology**:
    1.  Read each chapter from the perspective of the target audience.
    2.  Identify jargon that is not adequately explained.
    3.  Check for logical flow and coherent transitions between sections and paragraphs.
    4.  Ensure explanations are concise but comprehensive.
    5.  Verify that code examples are well-commented and integrated with the text.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Language is clear and accessible to the target audience.
    -   [ ] Jargon is explained or avoided.
    -   [ ] Logical flow is maintained throughout the chapter.
    -   [ ] Code examples are well-explained and commented.

## Consistency Review

-   **Objective**: Ensure uniform terminology, formatting, and stylistic choices across all chapters.
-   **Methodology**:
    1.  Cross-reference terminology with the `data-model.md` glossary.
    2.  Check for consistent use of code formatting, headings, and markdown elements.
    3.  Ensure a consistent tone and voice throughout the book.
    4.  Verify that cross-references to other chapters are correct.
-   **Checklist**:
    -   [ ] Terminology is consistent with `data-model.md`.
    -   [ ] Formatting and styling are uniform.
    -   [ ] Tone and voice are consistent.
    -   [ ] All internal cross-references are accurate.
